What can an actor do with products?
    1. Browse through the list of products.
        * This should be accessible to all actors.
        * Browsing doesn't require exposing all the characteristics of a product.
            * What characteristics are revealed?
                - Product Id
                - Product Name
                - Base Price
                - Brand
                - Main Image
                - Map of properties with no monetary value

                * The JSON object would look like:
                    {
                        "productId": <Long>
                        "productName": <String>
                        "basePrice": <BigDecimal>
                        "brand": <String>
                        "mainImage": <String>
                        "properties": <Map<String, List<String>>>
                    }
                * Suppose that for a product COLOUR & SIZE are non-monetary properties.
                  And they can take values (BLACK, WHITE & SKY BLUE) & (5.78In, 5.81In, 6.33In) respectively.
                  Then the properties map would look like:
                    {
                        "colour": [
                            "black",
                            "white",
                            "sky blue"
                        ],
                        "size": [
                            "5.78In",
                            "5.81In",
                            "6.33In"
                        ]
                    }
        * In addition to this general browsing (/api/v1/products/browse), browsing by name (/api/v1/products/browse/{product_name}) is also allowed.
            * Note that browsing by name utilizes LIKE expressions.
              So, the client doesn't have to provide the full name of the product.
