* Only REG_CUSTs own carts.
* Thus, JWT authentication occurs prior to accessing the cart. (For both ADMINs & REG_CUSTs.)

For what do REG_CUSTs access their cart?
    1. To get cart items.
        * Why?

    2. To add a variant to the cart.
    3. To remove a variant from the cart.
    4. Refresh the cart.
        * Why?
            * According to our design, adding variants to the cart does not deduct the stock count of the variant.
            * So, the front end needs to check for the consistency of the variant count in the cart & the variant count
              in the inventory when,
                i. Customer visits the CART PAGE & the front end has records on what variants (with what amount) are in the cart.
               ii. Customer is in the CART PAGE & the front end has records on what variants (with what amount) are in the cart.
                       Here, the front end needs to check regularly till the customer leaves the page.
              iii. Customer attempts to proceed to CHECKOUT PAGE.
                       Here, if both counts are consistent with each other, call the CREATEPLACEDORDER controller
                       method before visiting the CHECKOUT PAGE.

        * How?
            * Send a request to REFRESH_CART controller method with a JSON array like following.
                [
                    {
                        "variantId": 153,
                        "count": 7
                    },
                    {
                        "variantId": 167,
                        "count": 1
                    }
                ]

            * If the two counts are consistent with each other, the back end will send nothing.
            * Otherwise, it will send a JSON array like following.
                [
                    {
                        "variantId": 153,
                        "availableCount": 4
                    }
                ]
